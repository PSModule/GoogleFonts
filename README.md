# GoogleFonts

This is a PowerShell module for installing GoogleFonts on your system. This module and repository does not contain the fonts themselves,
but rather a way to install them on your system.

ðŸŽ‰ Kudos to the GoogleFonts community for keeping the library going! ðŸŽ‰
For any issues with the fonts themselves, please refer to the [GoogleFonts](https://github.com/google/fonts) repository.

## Prerequisites

This module depends on the [Fonts](https://psmodule.io/Fonts) module to manage fonts on the system.

## Installation

To install the module simply run the following command in a PowerShell terminal.

```powershell
Install-PSResource -Name GoogleFonts
Import-Module -Name GoogleFonts
```

## Usage

### Install a GoogleFont

To install a GoogleFont on the system you can use the following command.

```powershell
Install-GoogleFont -Name 'Roboto' # Tab completion works on name
```

To download the font from the GoogleFonts repository and install it on the system, run the following command.

```powershell
Install-GoogleFont -Name 'Roboto' -Scope AllUsers #Tab completion works on Scope too
```

### Install all GoogleFonts

To install all GoogleFonts on the system you can use the following command.

This will download and install all GoogleFonts to the current user.
```powershell
Install-GoogleFont -All
```

To install all GoogleFonts on the system for all users, run the following command.
This requires the shell to run in an elevated context (sudo or run as administrator).

```powershell
Install-GoogleFont -All -Scope AllUsers
```
